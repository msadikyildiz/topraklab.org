      "bio": "I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Toprak Lab at UT Southwestern. I received my PhD in Immunology from UT Southwestern, where I trained in the Van Oers Lab, and then worked briefly in industry. I joined the Toprak Lab in 2024 and have since worked on multiple projects while expanding my expertise in next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. My research includes building mutagenesis libraries of \u03b2-lactamases to study evolutionary trajectories and developing a highly efficient protocol for isolating bacteria from blood. I am also involved in one of the lab\u2019s most exciting projects focused on blood-based cancer diagnostics. Outside the lab, I enjoy playing with my dog (despite his lack of enthusiasm), cooking, going to the movies, and oil painting.",

      "bio": "I first joined the Toprak Lab as an undergraduate at Sabancı University, where I helped design and build several iterations of the original morbidostat. During my Ph.D. in Systems Biology at Harvard with Johan Paulsson, I built and ran the longest continuous culture evolution experiment to date and studied the limits of the fastest possible exponential growth. During and after graduate school, I helped Kernal Biologics develop computational tools for mRNA therapeutic payload optimization. I returned to the Toprak Lab in 2022 as a postdoctoral fellow at UT Southwestern. My current research is focused on the design of an end-to-end genomics pipeline from blood draw to diagnosis that powers our liquid biopsy program. This work led us to found Early Marker, a company translating circulating biomarker profiling into blood-based diagnostics for early detection of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. When I'm not checking out cryptic gene annotations or staring at code, I enjoy history and fiction, in print or on screen, or in the form of real-time strategy games.",
