## Visual Aesthetic
Cozy, dense, no-fluff, down-to-earth science. Tight vertical rhythm — content
should feel close-packed and information-rich, not airy or corporate. Avoid
generous padding between sections; let content breathe just enough to stay
readable, no more. When in doubt, less whitespace.
