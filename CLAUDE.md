# Toprak Lab Website

## Visual Aesthetic
Cozy, dense, no-fluff, down-to-earth science. Tight vertical rhythm — content
should feel close-packed and information-rich, not airy or corporate. Avoid
generous padding between sections; let content breathe just enough to stay
readable, no more. When in doubt, less whitespace.

When generating any prose, copy, pitch language, or visual/design work for
either Toprak Lab and Early Marker: write like scientists, not marketers.
Favor clarity, precision, and understated confidence. No buzzwords, no hype,
no startup theater. Our aesthetic is clean, data-dense, and typographically
rigorous — closer to a Nature Methods figure than a SaaS landing page.
